I just finished my first real code-from-scratch project on Learn.co! The goal of the project was to use object-orientated Ruby to scrape and return data from a website using a command-line interface.

My app lets you input the year of an NHL season, and then it scrapes a website for data from that year, and returns the players with the most assists, points, and goals for that year. Then, if you input one of their names, it returns some more data about them, like their age and weight.

It sounds pretty simple, but it took me longer than I was expecting to complete the project. I had to research a lot of little things and I feel like I spent a lot of time just sitting there thinking about how everything comes together. Even just getting all my files and requirements set up properly took me a bit as I hadn't done that from scratch yet. 

Overall though, I feel like I learned a lot and It's pretty awesome how much more I can do now than I could just a month ago. I'm looking forward to getting my code reviewed to see what I can improve on!
